Privacy Policy for Cflow

Last Updated: July 3, 2025

Thank you for using Cflow ("the Extension"). Your privacy is critically important to us.

1. Data Collection and Usage

The Cflow extension has a single purpose: to expand text shortcuts that you, the user, create. To achieve this, the extension operates with the following principles:

No Personal Data is Collected: We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information.
User-Created Rules are Stored Locally: The custom shortcuts and rules you create are saved using the standard chrome.storage API. This data is stored only on your local computer and is never sent to any external server.
No Website Data is Tracked: The extension runs on the websites you visit to detect and replace your shortcuts. It does not read, record, or transmit any other information from these websites. Your browsing activity remains completely private.
2. Permissions

The Cflow extension requires the minimum permissions necessary to function:

storage: To save your custom shortcuts locally on your device.
activeTab & Host Permissions: To allow the text-replacement functionality to work on the websites you use.
3. No Remote Code

The extension contains no remote code and operates entirely within your browser, ensuring your data is never exposed to external servers.

4. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy in the future. Any changes will be reflected in a new version of the extension.
